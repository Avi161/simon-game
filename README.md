# Simon Game

This is a simple implementation of the Simon Game, a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document for the Simon Game, containing the game interface and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `styles.css`: Contains styles for the Simon Game, defining the appearance of buttons, text, and overall layout.
- `game.js`: Implements the game logic, including functions for handling user interactions, generating game sequences, and managing game state.
- `sounds/`: Directory containing audio files for the game:
  - `blue.mp3`: Sound for the blue button.
  - `green.mp3`: Sound for the green button.
  - `red.mp3`: Sound for the red button.
  - `wrong.mp3`: Sound for an incorrect answer.
  - `yellow.mp3`: Sound for the yellow button.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will display a sequence of colors.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will play a "wrong" sound and display "Press Any Key to Start".
